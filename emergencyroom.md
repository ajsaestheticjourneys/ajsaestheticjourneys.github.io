<h1> HCAHPS Dashboard </h1>

<p> The Accident and Emergency (A&E) Dashboard presents key metrics on emergency care efficiency and performance.
The #RWFD project provides realistic but fictional datasets for data visualization and analysis practice. The dataset reveals insights into patient demographics, wait times (avg. ~35 min), and satisfaction scores (avg. ~5/10, though 6,699 scores are missing), volume trends, and admission rates, helping to identify patterns in emergency visits.The dashboard also breaks down demographic distributions, common diagnoses, and resource utilisation, offering a deeper understanding of A&E operations. Additionally, patient outcomes—such as discharge, transfer, or hospital admission—are analyzed to improve service delivery. By integrating RWFD’s data with an interactive A&E dashboard, healthcare professionals can better optimise patient flow, reduce wait times, and enhance emergency care decision-making. </p>

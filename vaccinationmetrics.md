    <h1>Vaccination Metrics</h1>
The Vaccination Dashboard for Massachusetts provides a detailed analysis of vaccination rates across the state, offering insights into vaccine distribution by county, age group, and other key demographics. A map visualisation highlights regional differences, making it easy to identify areas with higher or lower vaccination uptake among residents. The dashboard also breaks down vaccination rates by age group, showing trends in immunisation among different segments of the population. Additionally, it allows for comparisons over time, helping public health officials track vaccination progress, identify trends, and adjust strategies to improve coverage in under-vaccinated areas. By analysing these metrics, public health officials can track progress, address disparities, and optimise outreach efforts to ensure equitable vaccine distribution across all counties in Massachusetts.
